<p>My name is Jose Cervantez and I am a current Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. I will be applying to Organizational Behavior, Management and Social Psychology PhD programs in Fall 2021, with an anticipated start date of Fall 2022. My research is broadly focused on social equity and mobility. I am interested in how the individual traverses both occupational and social spaces while facing stereotype, discrimination, and prejudice.</p>
<p>My website has two primary purposes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To be a landing page for my research</p></li>
<li><p>To be space for others to learn foundational skills around statistics and programming</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I am a large advocate for sharing knowledge and building capacity in others. Feel free to look at my Resources tab for more information.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m always looking for collaborators, research discussions, and differences in opinion!</p>
