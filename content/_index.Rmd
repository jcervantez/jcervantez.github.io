My name is Jose Cervantez and I am 2nd year PhD student at The Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania. I am a part of the Decision Processes group within the Operations, Information and Decisions Department. I am currently working with Katy Milkman. My research interests revolve around diversity, equity and inclusion, and how interventions can help facilitate greater access across race and gender lines. My research is anchored within judgement and decision-making where human reliance on simple heuristics can lead us to make substantial biases, especially when it comes to reinforcing race and gender bias.
