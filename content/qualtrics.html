<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>Qualtrics is a very powerful survey creation tool that disguises itself very well for the amount of depth it affords. It can create simple 1-page forms with ease, as well as very complicated API web calls across software. As an aspiring behavioral scientisit, I though it would be helpful to document my most used tools as well as some helpful functions that researchers would be most likely to benefit from. These would be most helpful for those that have a beginner understanding of Qualtrics.</p>

<h2>Condition Assignment</h2>
<p>I personally like to work within the survey flow for the majority of my condition assignment. As a refresher, the survey flow gives you an overview of your <code>blocks</code> whereas the <code>survey builder</code> gives you an overview of your individual questions. By utilizing the survey flow, we can tell immediately how many conditions we have and the differences between the conditions.</p>
