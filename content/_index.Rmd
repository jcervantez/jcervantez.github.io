My name is Jose Cervantez and I am an incoming PhD student at The Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania. I will be joining the Decision Processes group within the Operations, Information and Decisions Department. I am planning to work with Katy Milkman. My research interests revolve around diversity, equity and inclusion, specifically in creating pathways for underrepresented minorities in both business and education. I have a strong preference for quantitative methods, primarily employing large scale field experiments. 

My website has two primary purposes: 

1. To be a landing page for my research

2. To be space for others to learn fundamental skills around statistics and programming

I am a large advocate for sharing knowledge and building capacity in others. Feel free to look at my Resources tab for more information.

I'm always looking for collaborators, research discussions, and differences in opinion!
