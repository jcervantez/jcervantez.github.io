My name is Jose Cervantez and I am current Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at UCLA Anderson School of Management. I will be planning to apply to Organizational Behavior, Management and Social Psychology PhD programs in Fall 2021, with an anticipated start date of Fall 2022. My research is broadly focused on social equity and mobility issues. I am interested in how the individual traverses both occupational and social spaces with the constant threat of stereotype, discrimination, and prejudice.
