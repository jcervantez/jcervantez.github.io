<p>My name is Jose Cervantez and I am an incoming PhD student at The Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania. I will be joining the Decision Processes group within the Operations, Information and Decisions Department. I am planning to work with Katy Milkman. My research interests revolve around diversity, equity and inclusion, specifically in creating pathways for underrepresented minorities in both business and education. I have a strong preference for quantitative methods, primarily employing large scale field experiments.</p>
<p>My website has two primary purposes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To be a landing page for my research</p></li>
<li><p>To be space for others to learn fundamental skills around statistics and programming</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I am a large advocate for sharing knowledge and building capacity in others. Feel free to look at my Resources tab for more information.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m always looking for collaborators, research discussions, and differences in opinion!</p>
