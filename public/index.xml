      <description>PreambleCondition AssignmentPreambleQualtrics is a very powerful survey creation tool that disguises itself very well for the amount of depth it affords. It can create simple 1-page forms with ease, as well as very complicated API web calls across software. As an aspiring behavioral scientisit, I though it would be helpful to document my most used tools as well as some helpful functions that researchers would be most likely to benefit from.</description>

      <description>PreamblePipe %&amp;gt;% Operatordplyr packagetidy dataPreambleOver the past couple of years, I’ve had the privilege to advance my R skills, as well as acquire useful functions that should aid anyone using R for behavioral science. This list is not exhaustive, but a list of my most used functions, packages, and useful tips!

      <description>Justice and Equity In the 11th century, St. Anselm of Canterbury argued that the will possesses two competing affinities: an affection for what is to a person’s own selfish advantage and an affection for justice. While the first inclination may be stronger, the second one is not far behind.[1]
We see these two competing affinities play out in modern society through the imbalances of power and the establishment of group-based hierarchies reinforced by race, gender, and social class.</description>
